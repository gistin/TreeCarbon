\title{Carbon tariff number for broadleaf tree}
\usage{
broadleaf_tariff(spcode, height, dbh, sigma_dbh = NA, sigma_h = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{spcode}{species code (single)}

\item{height}{tree height in meters}

\item{dbh}{diameter at breast height in centimetres}

\item{sigma_dbh}{sigma for diameter at breast height (optional)}

\item{sigma_h}{sigma for tree height (optional)}
}
\value{
tariff number and error if sigma of variables inputted
}
\description{
Use dbh and tree height to derive the tariff number of each
sample tree. Species-specific estimates of a1 â€“ a4 are found in the
R data file, 'tariff_broaddf'.
}
\examples{
broadleaf_tariff(spcode = 'OK', height = 25, dbh = 75)
